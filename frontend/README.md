# Frontend for Viniqufy

This is the frontend part of the **Viniqufy** application built with **React** and **Chakra UI*. The frontend is designed to interact with the backend API, which is built using **FastAPI**.

## Getting Started

To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/goldic342/viniqufy.git
   cd viniqufy/frontend
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Future Improvements from 26.08

Currently, the project is focused on functionality. Once all features are implemented, the styling will be enhanced to improve the user interface and experience.
